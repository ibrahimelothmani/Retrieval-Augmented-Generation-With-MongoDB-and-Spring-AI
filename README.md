# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with MongoDB and Spring AI: Bringing AI to Your Java Applications

# What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines vector search and large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware answers based on proprietary or external data that was not part of the modelâ€™s initial training. RAG consists of three main components:

Pre-trained LLM: We use OpenAI's GPT model to generate responses.
Vector search: We retrieve relevant documents from a MongoDB database.
Vector embeddings: Numerical representations of your data that capture semantic meaning.
